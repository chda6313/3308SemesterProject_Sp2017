Rebel-Scrum

Milestone 2

We will be using trello as our project tracking tool. We have a board of long term goals labled critical features. We have a backlog of user stories that are smaller tasks than the critical features. these tasks are color coded with the critical feature they are a part of. These tasks will be assigned due dates to define which sprint they will be a part of. We currently have due dates assigned forsome tasks up until Mar21.

We will be conducting three two-week sprints, assigning tasks from our backlog as we go. We will have weekly standup meetings instead of daily, because we are having trouble scheduling meetings when we can all be there.
