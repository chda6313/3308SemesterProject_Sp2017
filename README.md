#Description

This is a javascript/html based 2-d game where users are able to play as a lovable flying character to collect coins through the use of their keyboard.  There is also an editing feature where users can create their own levels, placing coins, blocks, and final goal posts that change color once all coins have been collected.  
 
The game has designed with the intention of allowing public contributions, our database has been built accordingly.  We are able to store usernames, dates, as well as the level design that will be taken from the creation page.
