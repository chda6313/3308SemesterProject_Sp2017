#Description

Our goal is to create a mobile game, for either Android or iOS platform. Users of this app will be able to edit and save their own levels, and upload them to a server if they choose. Other users will then be able to download their levels, and play them. There are a lot of features that we could put in in addition, including rating levels, tracking level creators who you like, and many different in game objects.

#Vision Statement

To provide entertainment to creative gamers, who want to share their ideas with others.

#Motivation

The main motivation for this product comes from Mario Maker, a similar game that is only for WiiU. This would allow players from all backgrounds to share their ideas.

#Risks

1. New platform, we have little experience developing for Android or iOS
2. Time limit / Other Commitments, we only have a semester to work on this project. We all have other classes, and other projects to work on, and as such, we might not find the time to work on this one.
3. New Team, none of us have experience working with eachother.

#Mitigation Strategy

1. Mobile development has exploded recently, and as such there is a lot of documentation and other resources online
2. Schecule time each week to work on this project, hopefully as a group.
3. Consistent group meetings will help us to get to know eachother, and our streangths and weaknesses as a group.

#Version Controll

We will be using GitHub as our version controll software. Our repository can be found at:

#Developmental Method

We will be using AGILE, with 1-2 week sprints, and weekly group meetings.

#Collaberation Tool

We have yet to decide on a tool all of us can use, but we will probably use Slack or HipChat
