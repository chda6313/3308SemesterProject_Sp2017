#Description

 Our goal is to create a mobile game, for either Android or iOS platform. Users of this app will be able to edit and save their own levels, and upload them to a server if they choose. Other users will then be able to download their levels, and play them. There are a lot of features that we could put in in addition, including rating levels, tracking level creators who you like, and many different in game objects.
 
The game will be designed with the intention of allowing public contributions, and will have a database that is built accordingly.  Besides being an enjoyable game to play, it will be a tool for fledgeling developers to begin to utilize their skills and create a finished product which can then be critiqued and improved upon by others.  

#Vision Statement

To provide entertainment to creative gamers, who want to share their ideas and visions with others. 

#Motivation

The main motivation for this product comes from Mario Maker, a similar game that is only for WiiU. This would allow players from all backgrounds to share their ideas, as it would only require a modern cell phone to play.  

#Risks

1. New platform, we have little experience developing for Android or iOS
2. Time limit / Other Commitments, we only have a semester to work on this project. We all have other classes, and other projects to work on, and as such, we might not find the time to work on this one.
3. New Team, none of us have experience working with eachother.

#Mitigation Strategy

1. Mobile development has exploded recently, and as such there is a lot of documentation and other resources online
2. Schedule time each week to work on this project, hopefully as a group.
3. Consistent group meetings will help us to get to know each other, and our strengths and weaknesses as a group.

#Version Control

We will be using GitHub as our version controll software. Our repository can be found at:

#Developmental Method

We will be using AGILE, with 1-2 week sprints, and weekly group scrums.  These will be held immediately before the lecture period.  There is also the possibility of adding a midweek virtual scrum if the need arises.  

#Collaboration Tool

We will use Slack to communicate throughout the duration of the project.  It will be used to update other members of the group on progress outside of our weekly scrums.
