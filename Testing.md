1) Coin Gathering -- This unit test looks at the functionality of our game to alter the color of the final platform
based upon whether or not all of the coins have been "collected", or the player has moved over them.  The tests are set up to
test for different numbers of coins, and checks the final color of the platform based upon the number that have been collected.
